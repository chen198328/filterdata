Abstract:A numerical model for dynamic soil-raft foundation interaction was developed by using the thin layered element method, and the dynamic response of irregularly shaped raft foundation subjected to inclined SH wave excitation was studied. L-shaped foundations and C-shaped foundations were considered. The results have shown that, when subjected to a non-vertically incident SH wave, with the increase of frequency as well as the increase of incident angle, the horizontal response decreases in a certain frequency range. And the torsional response is also generated. The irregularity of raft foundation has a great effect on the horizontal response. The trends are different in L-shaped foundations and C-shaped foundations, due to the different positions of the hole. The effects of the irregularity of raft foundation on the torsional response are very little in low-frequency region, but are great for the C-shaped foundations in high-frequency region.

Abstract:Based on the experimental research on the shear test behavior of two general beams and two overhanging RC beams strengthened with PVA-ECC, the regulations for the change of the mode of diagonal cracks, failure, deflection and strain have been analyzed in the experiment. The results show that this reinforced method can increase the crack-resisiting capacity and impove the shear stiffness and the load-bearing capacity of the beam. According to the test results, the computational formula of the shear load capacity of overhanging RC beams strengthened with PVA-ECC was established. The calculated results fit well with the experimental results, thus providing a theoretical reference for practical engineering designs.

Abstract:Based on the elastic theory of settlement analysis, a finite element method was employed to investigate the influence of inclined bedrock on foundation settlements under non-uniformly distributed load in terms of two key variables: the depth-width ratio and the bedrock inclination. The first variable refers to the ratio between the depth from the compressible soil to the bedrock and the width of the foundation, while the second assumes the dip perpendicular to the direction of the strip foundation. According to the numerical results, the design charts of settlement influencing factors and differential settlement influencing factors under different load conditions were given to help practice application. Besides, parameter analysis of the influence of calculating parameters on settlements and the position variation of the largest settlement with the change of the depth-width ratio and the bedrock inclination were given.Morover, a design example was presented to illustrate the use of the design charts.

Abstract:In order to decrease the measurement error of the traditional dual-energy &gamma;-ray method and reduce the impact of the ash component on detection accuracy in ash determination, a new coal ash measurement model based on fuzzy neural network and the dual-energy &gamma;-ray was established, and then the model was applied on online testing of coal ash content. The application of the traditional and new coal ash measurement model was analyzed by online testing, and the measurement results of both were comparatively analyzed. The results show that the relative error of ash content using the new method was less than 1%, while the average relative error of the traditional measurement was about 3%, and the measurement accuracy of the new method is not affected by the ash component. Meanwhile, the relationship between the chemical composition of coal ash and ash content was analyzed by using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), and the results indicate that the content of Fe, Ca, Mg and S elements in coal can affect the detection accuracy of traditional dual-energy &gamma;-ray dialysis, the greater fluctuations of their ingredient content result in greater measurement error.

Abstract:To address the longitudinal shear capacity of composite slabs, this paper finds a kind of interlocking effect existing in a new type of composite slab, which is a new kind of shear mechanism and expounds its mechanism. In order to verify the effectiveness of this type of shear mechanism, monodirectional pseudo-static tests for six composite specimens with three kinds of structural forms of the precast panel were conducted. By comparing the integral behavior of the composite slab in ultimate load, hysteric curve, self-resetting property and so on, the results indicate that, when compared with ordinary prestressed concrete composite slabs, owing to its less damage accumulation in the lamination of this new type of composite slab, the proposed interlocking effect can enhance the deformation recovery performance to some extent and ensure that the composite slabs have good interaction between the laminated layer and the precast panel to give full play to its ultimate load.

Abstract:An analytical model for the reliability of the embedded depth of rigid anti-slide pile was established by introducing the bi-parameter approach used in the computation of lateral loaded pile. A reliability index target was determined by searching for the minimum of reliability index at a specified embedded depth incorporating with stochastic optimization algorithm, and was used to guide the design for the embedded depth of rigid anti-slide pile. Practical case study demonstrated that it was more economical to determine the embedded depth in the bi-parameter approach than in traditional ground coefficient methods. Analysis of the parametric sensitivity indicated that the determination of the embedded depth of the rigid anti-slide pile was more sensitive to the unit weight, internal frictional angle and cohesion of sliding mass than to the gravity of the embedded length and the proportional coefficient of ground coefficient. It is suggested that more concern be given to the variation of the former three parameters when conducting the embedded depth design of rigid anti-slide pile.

Abstract:Three circular columns confined by low-prestressed steel belts and two normal columns were tested under axial load and cyclic lateral force, and the bearing capacity, hysteretic behavior and ductility were examined. The main parameters were the axial compression ratio and the arrangement of steel belts. Test results indicate that the seismic performance of the RC columns confined by low-prestressed steel belts was greatly improved because the development of oblique cracks was inhibited, and with the greater range of the plastic hinge region, the deformability of confined columns was enhanced.

Abstract:The impact fatigue performances of different combinations of WC grain size and Co phase cemented carbides were tested by low cycle impact test procedure, and then, their toughness and toughening effects were evaluated. The results have shown that the low cycle impact fatigue performances of cemented carbides are enhanced with the increase of cobalt content when the WC grain size is certain.The impact fatigue resistance of cemented carbide with an average grain size of 1.8 &mu;m is weaker than cemented carbide with an average grain size of 6.5 &mu;m at the same level of cobalt content. The low cycle impact fatigue performance is more effective than the conventional toughness indicators of cemented carbides in evaluating toughness and toughening effects.

Abstract:As the span of conventional cable-stayed bridges reaches 1,200 m or longer, accumulated horizontal force components of the stay cables cause huge axial pressure in the girder, leading to sharp increases of girder dimension and weight, which makes it difficult to compete with suspension bridges in terms of economic consideration. In this paper, a new type of cable-stayed bridge is proposed, namely the partial ground-anchored cable-stayed bridge with crossing stay cables. In this new cable-stayed bridge system, long stay cables cross with each other in the midspan zone of the main span while the other ends of the long cables are anchored to the ground in the side spans. By this design, the long cables result in no additional horizontal pressure to the main girder, and the ratio of pylon height to span length can be reduced. A comparative analysis of this new bridge system with a conventional self-anchored cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 1,408 m is carried out. Results show that by using the new bridge system, the horizontal pressure in the main girder can be reduced by 29.6%, and the total cost can be reduced by 11.8%. Furthermore, the size of ground anchors for this new bridge system is only about 30% of that of a suspension bridge with the same span length. Finally, a cantilever construction method for the new bridge system is introduced as well. &copy; 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:Manganese sulfate solution with high iron content was obtained by leaching a kind of low-grade pyrolusite from Hunan Province with pyrites and concentrated sulfuric acid, or, in the two-ore-acid-leaching method. The methods of iron deep-removing from the manganese sulfate solution were studied. Various iron-removing methods were compared, such as neutralizing hydrolysis method, partial hydrolysis of goethite method, and ammonium jarosite process method, ammonium jarosite-goethite union method. The results showed that ammonium jarosite-goethite union method was most suitable for the removal of iron from the solution. The iron removal rate reached 99.96% at 90&deg;C in a 1 hour reaction. Meanwhile, the manganese loss rate was lower, the slag volume was smaller and the filtration was easier. The deep-removing of iron has laid a foundation for the preparation of high purified manganese sulfate solution.

Abstract:In order to study the regional capital liquidity, Bayesian panel smooth transition regression models were established to address uncertain risk of parameters estimation in PSTR models. Based on the analysis of model statistic structure and the selection of parameters prior, the Metropolis-Hasting within Gibbs sampling method was utilized to estimate model parameters, avoiding the convergent problem when using the nonlinear least square method in PSTR model. The empirical research applies Bayesian PSTR to analyse the panel data of investment and saving in Chinese provinces. The research outcome indicates that the iteration trace of parameters is convergent, and the Metropolis-Hasting within Gibbs sampling method estimates model parameters accurately, showing the effectiveness of Bayesian PSTR model approach.

Abstract:At high speed, the calculated result has deviation compared with that of practical situation if the smaller stiffness parts are regarded as pure rigid body. Based on rigid-flexible coupling dynamic theory, a dynamic model of pusher device system with rigid-flexible coupling of a packaging machine was built in the finite element method and modal superposition method, and the smaller stiffness parts were softened. The dynamic stress of the pushing hands during pushing and folding procedures were calculated according to the above model. The validity of this method was verified by comparing the results with the conclusion in ABAQUS. A comparative study of the pusher device's multi-rigid-body calculation model and rigid-flexible coupling dynamics model has shown that the distortion of flexible pushing hands causes positional deviation, which verifies that the calculation result of the rigid-flexible coupling dynamics model is more accurate at high speed.

Abstract:The polypyrrole(PPy) films were synthesized in pyrrole and NaClO<inf>4</inf> aqueous or acetonitrile solution on stainless steel by cyclic voltammetry. The morphology of PPy films was observed by scanning electron microscopy, the conductivity was measured by four-probe and its corrosion protection properties were investigated by potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1 mol/L H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>. The morphology of two kinds of PPy films showed spherical type, but that prepared in water had more nodules. The conductivity of the PPy prepared in acetonitrile was higher than that in water, and aslo provided better protection properties for stainless steel. The donor number of acetonitrile was smaller than that of water, and acetonitrile had little reaction with polymer intermediates which was difficult to end the chain reactions. As a result, PPy film prepared in acetonitrile possessed with long conjugacy-length, small structure defects, high conductivity and better corrosion-resistance.

Moreover, a series of benzofuranneolignan compounds 3~7 and benzodioxaneneolignan compounds 8~10 were synthesized from compounds 1 and 2 respectively through acetylation, DDQ oxydehydrogenation, Pd/C catalytic hydrogenation, lithium aluminium hydride reduction and deacetylation in alkaline condition. All of these synthesized compounds were confirmed with MS, IR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR and <sup>13</sup> C NMR spectra. Among them, 5~7, 9 and 10 are new compounds. 8 is the natural product isoamericanol A. The biological activities of benzofuranneolignan compounds 1, 3~5 against five human cancer cell lines were evaluated in the standard MTT method, and the results have shown that compounds1, 3, 4 and 5 exhibit good inhibitory effect on leukemia cells (HL-60), lung carcinoma cell (A-549), breast cancer cell (MCF-7), colon cancer cell (SW-480), and hepatoma carcinoma cell (SMMC-7721).

Abstract:To measure the corrosion resistance of stainless steel and to study the corrosion protection mechanism of polypyrrole film (PPy) on stainless steel, measurement methods such as cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) and open circuit potential time curve were used to detect the electrochemical behavior of stainless steel/PPy in Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate(SDBS)and NaCl solution. Then, a reasonable equivalent circuit was established to explain the EIS. The result indicated that reasonable equivalent circuit could isolate the corrosion resistance of stainless steel and the redox resistance of PPy, which perfectly explained the impedance behavior of stainless steel/PPy in solution. In 3.5%NaCl solution, the PPy has good corrosion inhibition effect on stainless steel. The electrochemical reaction between stainless steel and PPy film could release DBS<sup>-</sup> and insoluble substance to inhibit metal corrosion, which would be the corrosion resistance mechanism of polypyrrole film (PPy) on stainless steel.

Abstract:This paper presented a new method to suppress vortex-induced vibration by controlling the phase of fluctuation aerodynamic loads with synthetic jet. In order to verify the phase control function of synthetic jet and study the parameters range in which the phase control can be implemented, the two-dimensional unsteady flow around E214 airfoil was simulated numerically with CFD software. The time history of lift coefficient was obtained. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) was performed to get the fundamental frequency of fluctuation aerodynamic loads under large attack angle without synthetic jet control. The method to judge whether the synthetic jet can control the phase of fluctuation aerodynamic loads was obtained. Based on the data of a series of numerical simulation, the velocity- frequency ranges in which the synthetic jet can control the phase of fluctuation aerodynamic loads were obtained. The results have shown that the velocity and frequency of the synthetic jet can influence the phase control function of the synthetic jet significantly. When the frequency of the synthetic jet is close to the frequency of fluctuation aerodynamic loads without synthetic jet control, the synthetic jet can achieve phase control with lower control energy. On the contrary, much control energy is needed.

Abstract:A model of a built-in children restraint system was set up. The method of coupling between MADYMO and LS-DYNA was used in simulation and a sled test was adopted to validate this model. First, side impact simulations were carried out respectively for vehicle seat without armrest, with different types of armrests and the combination of armrest and lateral flank. Then, an analysis of the influence of the different heights of armrest for children was done through other side impact simulations. Finally, the simulation results were analyzed. The results show that the armrest can prevent the child occupant from slipping out of the seat cushion so as to avoid suffocation death caused by neck bridled, while lateral flank can protect children's neck and chest effectively. Vehicle seat with the combination of lateral flank and armrest can provide the best protection for children in all types. The results also show that the seat with moderate armrest height can provide the best protection for children.

Abstract:In order to study the fatigue life of the lift mechanism of mining wrecker and optimize the design of the weak part, a model of a rigid-flexible coupling system was established by integrating multi-body dynamic simulation and finite element method. Regarding dynamic analysis results as the random load of fatigue life analysis of lift mechanism, fatigue life contours were obtained and the minimum life was low. Based on SIMP method, topology optimization of lift mechanism was studied, and the multi-stiffness of static and eigenfrequencies were regarded as the optimization objectives. Then, the size optimization of the lift mechanism was studied. Compared with the stiffness and fatigue life of original lift institution, the performances of optimized structure are improved by 11.7% and 521%, which provides reference and basis for the design of the mining wrecker lift institution.

Abstract:To investigate the seismic behavior of RC frames with energy conservation masonry infill walls, two RC frame models with two-floor single span, one with infill walls and the other without infill walls (bare frame), were tested with the pseudo-static experiment. The cracking distribution of frame with infill walls was described, and the load-displacement hysteretic curves, skeleton curves, rigidity degradation and strength degradation were discussed in comparison with the bare frame. The results show that the lateral load-bearing capacity and structural lateral stiffness of the RC frame, but not the ductility, can be increased by infilling walls in the frame. Due to the presence of the infill walls, the rigidity degradation and strength degradation of the frames will be sped up. However, there is still enough stiffness when the RC frame with infill walls is destroyed, which indicates the good resistance to collapse resistance of the frame with energy conservation masonry infill wall.

Abstract:A modified two-dimensional (2D) Moses algorithm for acquiring the field-calibrated influence line (IL) of an existing bridge is presented, based on strain data acquired continuously at a high scanning rate with calibration vehicles of known axle weights and axle spacings crossing an instrumented bridge. Considering the transverse distribution of the wheel loads on each girder attributable to the 2D behavior of the slab-girder bridge, the IL of each of the girders can be calculated, which does not require the girders to possess identical material and geometric properties. By using the calculated IL of each girder as a reference, a modified 2D Moses algorithm was derived to identify axle weights of moving vehicles, taking into consideration the transverse distribution of the wheel loads on each girder. Mathematical equations to calculate ILs and axle weights were derived, and the proposed algorithms were implemented by a computer program. The accuracy of the IL calculation and axle weight identification was verified through a field test of a bridge on U.S. Route 78 in Alabama. The identified axle weights showed agreement with the static measurements from weighing pads and with results from the bending-plate weigh-in-motion (BPWIM) system near the instrumented bridge. &copy; 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:Hexachlorobenzene's (HCB's) estrogenicity change and potential mechanisms when mixing with a typical natural estrogen, 17-Estradiol (E2), were investigated. Human breast cancer cell MCF-7 increase examination was used. The results showed that HCB had very strong estrogenicity, but the mixture of HCB and E2 showed strong rivalry effect, i.e., E2 and HCB greatly weakened each other on endocrine disrupting effect. Mechanism analyses showed that E2 and HCB could interfere with the endocrine system via the endocrine receptor channel and the MAPK signal channel. The rivalry effect between E2 and HCB was unrelated with the traditional endocrine receptor channel, but depended strongly on the non-traditional ERK channel. E2 decreased the HCB activation of ERK protein, and decreased the expression of p-ERK protein, thus interrupting the transcription of MAPK signal. The transcription factor analyses showed that E2 weakened the function of HCB mainly by decreasing the expression of c-Myc protein.

Abstract:This paper investigated the discharging mechanism of dry-type transformer by analyzing the outside insulation surface electric-field distribution of a 10kV epoxy resin cast dry-type transformer. Firstly, the 2-D finite element model was established, and on this basis the surface electric-field distributions were analyzed under two operating environments of the dry outside insulation surface and the external insulation surface with wetting layer. The results have indicated that the local electric-field density of external insulation surface rises nearly ten times compared with the dry external surface, which is easy to cause the creeping discharging phenomenon and poses a threat to external insulation. A type of low surface energy coating was used on the transformer to prevent the surface discharging phenomenon, and the electric-field distribution was analyzed when the coating surface was covered with dispersed water drops. Compared with the above results, it is obvious that the surface electric-field density decreases eighty percent, which can effectively increase the life of the epoxy resin cast dry-type transformer.

Abstract:A suspension roll mechanic model was set up, and by using the initial parameter method of structural mechanics, the analytical solution of the torsional stiffness of torsion beam with stabilizer bar was deduced, on the basis of which the mathematical model of its equivalent roll stiffness at the wheels was established. The mathematical model was verified by simulating the corresponding model set up with ABAQUS software. Then, combined with NSGA-II algorithm, an optimization was conducted on the roll stiffness and the total quality of the beam. The results have shown that the roll stiffness and total quality of the beam get a good balance and the optimization method is reliable, which has theoretical guidance for the design and choice of characteristic parameters of the torsion beam rear axle in the primary stage of development.

Abstract:The seismic collapse-resistant capacity of the three-dimensional (3D) parking structure with alternation story-height truss lateral-load-resisting system was evaluated by IDA-based seismic fragility analysis method. The structural collapse process and mechanism under earthquake were analyzed. The seismic collapse-resistant capacities of the structure under one-directional and bi-directional earthquakes were compared. And the comparison of the seismic collapse-resistant capacities and collapse margin ratios of the structures with different floors was carried out. The result has shown that the seismic collapse-resistant performance of this kind of 3D parking structure is very good, and the first storey is the weak storey. The collapse probability increases with the increase of the storey count of the structure, and then the seismic performance becomes weak. However, the collapse margin ratio of the structure does not always decrease with the increase of the storey count of the structure. It is recommended that the provision of the height-width ratio in the current design code of building structure can be broken in the design of this kind of 3D parking structure.

Abstract:The forecast of the current urban road travel time is mostly limited to single-source data and the prediction accuracy is not high. Based on the floating car GPS data and microwave detector traffic data, a model of travel time was built in the fusion method. Wavelet neural network was optimized by using genetic algorithms, which can solve the blindness and the randomness of selecting wavelet neural network initial parameter, thus greatly improving Web search efficiency and the speed of training. The predicted travel time is in good agreement with video observed data. The results show that the model is effective and reliable.

Abstract:Abstract A novel approach for discrete multibody system modeling is presented. The approach segments the multibody system into a series of subsystems with kinematic constraints. The equations of motion of the unconstrained subsystems are either easier to obtain or already exist. The Udwadia-Kalaba equation is then introduced to calculate the constraint forces due to the constraints. The approach does not require any auxiliary variables, such as Lagrange multipliers, and does not need to use any projection. It can systematically reach the model via clustering of the segments. &copy; 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:A novel power quality conditioning system based on the YN_&forall; balance transformer to improve the power quality, such as negative sequence, harmonic and lower power factor in electric railways with AT or direct power supply, was proposed. The system fully uses the potential of the traction transformer secondary side with three-phase system, and it integrates the three-phase full-bridge active power regulation system with the main transformer omitting step-down transformer. The composition method of the system, the principle of the compensation of the negative sequence and harmonic and reactive power were described. The current detection and control methods were also proposed. According to the actual parameter and measured data in a substation, a system simulation model was built. The results indicate that the proposed system has excellent performance in the compensation of the negative sequence, harmonic and reactive power.

Abstract:Inspired from the clonal selection mechanism of immune systems and the theory of the cloud model, a chaos clonal selection algorithm based on cloud model was proposed to improve the algorithm. Firstly, the algorithm adopts chaos initialization to generate the initial population in order to improve the quality of initial antibodies. Secondly, the algorithm employs the basic normal cloud generator to achieve antibodies mutation operation in order to improve the diversity of antibodies. Finally, the simulation test of classical function and the parameters tuning of time-delay system with active-disturbance-rejection controller shows that the algorithm can search for the best solution more quickly. Its precision is higher and its stability is better than the CSA, GA and PSO.

Abstract:A distribution network reconfiguration algorithm based on heuristic rules and harmony search algorithm (HSA) was proposed. At first, the codification strategy based on the reconstruction loops was adopted according to the characteristics of distribution network reconfiguration and HSA. Then, several special branch groups were constructed and several disconnecting rules were set to avoid the infeasible solutions. Furthermore, the initial network was analyzed with the objective function for the minimization of power loss, and the effective search space of each loop was shrunk by using heuristic rules. Finally, the harmony search algorithm was used to search the global optimal solution. Using the proposed method, the number of candidate solutions can be reduced greatly, the optimal solution can be achieved rapidly, and the search performance will not be worse with the expansion of the network. The simulation results of IEEE typical examples have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract:In order to optimize the performance of engine bleeding brake, a three-dimensional model was built with UG. The model was divided into grid by the dynamic mesh technique. Besides, the motion rule of the intake valve and piston was set and defined. By applying the three-dimensional transient numerical simulation in the process of engine brake working by Fluent, the changes of pition pressure were analyzed. According to the piston's instantaneous force, the engine average braking power in different conditions was calculated, and then the influence of exhaust valve lash, engine speed and exhaust back pressure on engine braking performance was also obtained. By optimizing working parameters, the performance of engine bleeding brake was enhanced, and the simulation results were verified with experiments. The results have shown that the maximum error is 5.2%, and the smallest error is only 4.1%. It is shown that the simulation results are of high precision and accuracy.

Abstract:Packet loss rate is one of the basic network performance metrics. However, current measurement methods conflict with measuring precision and costs. A self-adaptive sampling based loss rate measurement method was proposed in this paper. By utilizing the characteristics of delay-loss correlation and loss-loss correlation, it dynamically adjusts probing period adaptively, under the indications of larger delay samples and loss events in measuring process on burst losses. Consequently, it improves the measuring accuracy without the dramatic increase of probing costs. Simulation results have shown that a good trade-off is obtained in this method. When compared with ping, it gets much lower errors with a minor increase of probing costs; and compared with BADABING, the errors are similar, but it greatly decreases probing costs.

Abstract:Based on the minimum thermal resistance theory and homogenization method, the effective thermal conductivity of hollow beads insulating mortar was estimated. With ANSYS imitating the heat transmission of the 2D unit model of hollow beads insulating mortar, we can find it will bring about calculation errors by considering the extreme cases of the transverse thermal resistance of resistance network. Compared with the effective thermal conductivity of 3D unit cell model calculated by ANSYS with three kinds of theoretical calculating value, it is more accurate than the effective thermal conductivity of unit calculated by the model of effective thermal resistance average. A model was built by assuming transverse thermal resistance infinitesimal and infinite. Final laboratory finding also confirms this conclusion. With only 0.2% deviation between the experiment values and the calculation of theoretical model, it is feasible to estimate the effective thermal conductivity of hollow bead insulating mortar.

Abstract:A series of LiAlO<inf>2</inf>-Li<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> solid state lithium ion electrolyte materials were prepared through solid-phase reaction. The influences of experimental operating parameters such as the Molar ratio of materials, and the sintering temperature on the characteristics of the sintered samples were investigated. The results showed that, at 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of LiAlO<inf>2</inf> and Li<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf>, the specimens sintered at 1000&deg;C consisted of &gamma;-LiAlO<inf>2</inf> flakes and &gamma;-Li<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> spheres, and the sizes of particles ranged from 0.5 to 1 &mu;m. When the stoichiometric ratio of LiAlO<inf>2</inf> and Li<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> was 1:3, the specimens sintered at 1000&deg;C consisted of mainly Al doped spherical &gamma;-Li<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> solid solution and its ionic conductivity was 6.4&times;10<sup>-5</sup> S/cm. It indicated that Al doping could effectively improve the ionic conductivity of Li<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> inorganic solid electrolyte. When the Al doped specimens were sintered at 1100&deg;C, the ionic conductivity decreased. The results of cyclic voltammetry showed that the Al doped &gamma;-Li<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> solid electrolyte materials had a good electrochemical reversibility in saturated LiNO<inf>3</inf> solution, and an electrochemical window of 1.5V was observed.

Abstract:To overcome the shortcomings of the conventional SVM for diode clamped multilevel inverter, a classification algorithm based on Kohonen's competitive NN was propsed. Although the algorithm is an NN-based one, it does not need a training stage. The proposed SVM switching strategy eliminates the time consuming operations, so the whole procedure for the implementation of the algorithm is carried out with simple mathematical operations. The validity of mathematical analysis and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm were verified with simulation studies for both a three-level DCI and a five-level DCI. The simulation studies also verify that the proposed algorithm is a generalized one for an n-level DCI and does not need any modification when the number of levels increases.

Abstract:The load transfer mechanism of big-diameter rock-socketed pile was studied based on the rock-socketed pile static load test report of Mishui River Bridge, by conducting situ experiments. Based on the analysis of data from conducting situ experiments of the pile, the pile top load displacement curve was obtained, as well as the relationship of resistance size of rock surrounding the pile with displacement and the share ratio of pile side and end resistance, etc. The research results show that the friction resistance of pile body is influenced not only by limit friction resistance but also by normal stress. The value of limit side resistance provided by the prospecting report is smaller. The socketed section bears most of the pile top load, and the friction of socketed section plays the leading role, for the performance of the friction pile. In the process of loading, the proportion of the side of pile soil resistance decreaseds gradually, while socketed section total resistance increases gradually, and finally tends to be stable.

Abstract:Up to now there has been no special monitoring equipment or platform for the energy efficiency measurement of large power rectifier system. For this reason, a new method of energy efficiency measurement of large power rectifier system based on the fiber optic Ethernet communication was presented. In order to prove the advantages of the new method, this paper made a comprehensive and comparative study of the measuring principles, and the analytical method of energy efficiency. The method of indirect inversion of heavy direct current proves to be correct and can be well applied in practical projects through simulation and experiments. Finally, by combining with engineering practice, the specific implementation process of the new analytical method of energy efficiency was described. The project case indicates that the efficiency analytic method can correctly calculate the efficiency of the power-supply system of the industrial rectifier system, and can provide a proof of improving the efficiency of the equipments and saving the energy of the system.

Abstract:This paper presented the prototype of a buckling plate vibration isolator with the propitious characteristic of quasi-zero stiffness (QZS). The isolator was devised by combining a rubber pad with a buckling steel plate. To facilitate the analysis of the characteristics of the QZS isolator, an approximate expression of force and displacement was formulated on the basis of Abaqus analysis and Matlab tool. Analytical result reveals the stiffness criterion of the supporting rubber for the QZS system. The force transmissibility of the vibration isolation systems was derived in the harmonic balance method (HB), and the effects of the damping were investigated for the performance evaluation of the systems. The results show that the QZS isolator can outperform the linear system in low frequency domain, and there is no involvement of resonance when damping is set properly.

Abstract:Seismic retrofit of reinforced concrete (RC) columns using fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) jacketing has been widely investigated. However, the residual performance of FRP retrofitted columns after surviving earthquake attacks remains as an issue with little research. As a follow up of a previous experimental study, this paper reports the analysis of the axial loading creep behavior of FRP retrofitted RC columns with different degrees of simulated earthquake damage. The damage degree and residual strains in FRP after lateral loading are assessed based on previous maximum lateral displacement excursion. A creep model for damaged columns with FRP jacket is presented based on the age-adjusted effective modulus method for creep of concrete and the Findley's power law function for creep of FRP jacket. The creep model considers the effects of previous damage, sealed concrete, multiaxial stress state of stresses and stress redistribution. The proposed model is validated against previous creep tests of fiber-wrapped concrete columns by other researchers and the long-term tests conducted by the authors. Finally, a detailed study is carried out to identify the practical design parameters affecting creep of hybrid columns. The analytical results show that the creep of the FRP confined column increases as the damage degree becomes larger and exhibits notable nonlinear feature. The creep life declines and may cause creep rupture of the FRP when retrofitted columns suffer serious earthquake damage or under high axial load. &copy; 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:In order to investigate the thermal load distribution of modified piston, it is necessary to analyze temperature field and thermal stress combined simulation with experiments. The FE software was used to simulate the temperature field of the piston after the boundary conditions of thermal transfer were calculated, and then, the results were verified according to experiment data, and the error of calculation was less than 5%. Finally, temperature field and thermal stress were derived under different operating conditions including conditions A and B. The results of investigation show that the maximum temperature and maximum value of thermal stress of modified piston decrease compared with the original piston. The modified piston meets the demand of thermal load based on the original piston meeting the demand of thermal load.

Abstract:In the permanent magnet brushless DC motor (BLDCM) control system, a new ADRC brushless DC motor control system was propsed in order to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the control system and to simplify the controller structure and the debugging process. In motor control, auto disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) is the effective means to improve the robustness of a system, but it has a lot of parameters to be adjusted, which is not good for practical application. This paper used fuzzy control technology to facilitate ADRC parameter self-tuning. This method not only maintains the original excellent performance of ADRC, but also improves the adaptive capacity. Combined with the characteristics of brushless DC motor itself, this paper deduced the second-order equation of BLDCM by using only one parameter fuzzy self-tuning ADRC to achieve a brushless DC motor operation control system. Simulation results have shown that this control system has strong adaptability and robustness in the condition of BLDCM internal parameter perturbation and external disturbances. Experiment results have also shown the feasibility and effectiveness of this system.

Abstract:A numerical experiment was adopted to analyze the effects of wind speed, initial wind angle, elevation difference and ice thickness on the longitudinal unbalance tension of transmission tower. Harmony-superposition method was used to simulate the fluctuating wind speed time series acting on the transmission tower line, and the law of unbalance tension was derived by changing elevation difference and ice thickness. The results have shown that, in some cases, the value of the longitudinal unbalance tension of the tower in existing electricity industry standard is smaller. Based on computational analysis, the theoretical formula of the longitudinal unbalance tension of towers subjected to wind and snow simultaneously was proposed. The errors of the formula are within &plusmn; 6% compared with numerical simulation. It has preferable accuracy.

Abstract:Battery SOC estimation accuracy is one of the important factors influencing the performance of electric vehicles. Considering that the traditional Kalman filter calls for the undersdanding of the statistical properties of system noise, a fuzzy adaptive Kalman filtering algorithm was presented, which was based on RC equivalent circuit model and identified by applying multiple linear regression method. Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule simulation comparative results have shown that the proposed algorithm has higher SOC estimation accuracy than the conventional Kalman algorithm and can keep error within 2%.

Abstract:This paper presented a multi-domain boundary face method (MD-BFM) to solve steady-state heat conduction problems in large-scale engineering structures. Based on BFM, and using a similar approach as that in single-domain problems, this paper derived the matrix assembly process in multi-domain problems. Then, temperature and other unknown quantities can be drawn from the discrete boundary integral equation. The multi-domain BFM was developed and applied to the steady state heat conduction analysis of an actual gravity dam, which contained 62 concrete layers (totally 125 domains). In order to verify the result, the temperature contours of the dam were compared with the result obtained from FEM (using Abaqus). The comparison chart has shown that the maximum temperature value of both results is 20.7&deg;C. Moreover, the contours are highly consistent. Numerical results have demonstrated that our method can achieve comparable accuracy than other methods (e. g. the FEM) at much lower cost in terms of both computer resources and human labor.

Abstract:Methods in numerical simulation combined with experiments were used to study the influence of heat-treated condition and process sequences on the springback of 6063 aluminum bent profiles. The results show that the inner and outer materials of profile cross-section during bending process suffer compressive and tensile stress, while the nearby neutral fiber suffers an obvious tensile-compressive stress concentration. The neutral fiber of the whole plastic deformation region has a larger residual tensile stress after unloading. The springback angle of extruded profile increases after artificial aging. With the increase of artificial aging time, the difference of maximum tensile and compressive stress between the inner and outer materials increases, and consequently, the springback angle gradually increases. The curved profile also rebounds after artificial aging and electrophoresis paint, and with the increase of the bending angle, the springback angle increases. The artificial aging time further increases, but the rebound angle of curved profile remains unchanged. The total springback angle is minimum when the extruded profile is first processed by cold bending, and then by artificial aging and electrophoresis painting.

Abstract:To solve the problem of epistasis analysis in genome-wide, a filter method based on multiple criteria fusion was developed to remove the unrelated SNP loci. After that, ant colony algorithm was used to construct the SNP set with epistasis interaction. In the phase of constructing, a support vector machine was proposed to build the relationship between the SNP set and complex diseases. The experiment results show that, with multiple criteria evaluating each SNP and ant colony optimization, the prediction accuracy and running time have been improved, making it better than conventional methods.

Abstract:In traditional Active Front Steering System, the ideal variable steering ratio curve has the defect of non-smooth property, thus inducing torque fluctuation of the electric motor. This paper aims at designing a smooth fitting variable steering ratio curve based on vehicle model, through a comparative analysis of five different kinds of fitting variable steering ratio curves. The analysis indicates that the modified sigmoid fitting curve has the best overall performance due to its closeness to the ideal curve and mininal influence on the torque fluctuation of the electric motor. Furthermore, simulation in MATLAB/Simulink validates the good property of the modified sigmoid fitting curve.

Abstract:The impacts of temperature, flow and lift of cooling water on the energy efficiency ratio of surface water source heat pump system were analyzed. The cooling load of air condition and parameters of cold water were set as control objectives, and the analytical model of energy efficiency ratio of cooling water system including energy consumption of water source heat pump was proposed. The running energy efficiency ratios of two types of surface water source heat pump systems (direct heat transfer of surface water flowing into chilling water unit directly, and indirect heat transfer through plate heat exchanger) were analyzed by using this model. The results show that the impact of change of cooling water temperature on energy efficiency ratio is bigger than change of lift of cooling water system. In partial load condition, the energy efficiency ratio of chilling water unit and cooling water system reaches the maximum when the temperature of cooling water is 23~24&deg;C.

Abstract:In response to the problem of rigid link of anchorage point, which occurs to spatial cable fixed on the girder and the tower of cable-stayed bridge, on the basis of tangent stiffness matrix of nonlinear spatial truss element by differential method, and according to the characteristics of the forced rigid arm without deformation but rigid motion, the relationships between the total amount and increment of the displacement and the end force of ends of rigid arms in global coordinate system were presented by treating rigid arm as the spatial vector and employing its finite rotation formula and differential method. Then, the explicit expressions of nonlinear tangent stiffness matrix of spatial stay cable 3-D truss element with rigid arms on both ends were obtained. A finite element program based on the algorithm was developed to analyze the geometric nonlinear behaviors of cable-stayed bridge. Three examples, including spatial trussed structure with or without rigid arms and a cable-stayed bridge in construction process, were employed to perform spatial geometrical nonlinear analysis. The results show that the new algorithm can solve the rigid link of anchorage point completely, and it provides a powerful tool for refined geometrical nonlinear analysis of cable-stayed bridge.

Abstract:With the development of clean energy in the electric power system, wind power has been utilized in large scale, but its characteristics will deeply affect the stability of the power system. This paper compared the wind turbine structure of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and direct drive synchronous generator (DDSG), and analyzed their reduced order model. Wind power turbines were added to the system of two regional systems. The systems had good damping properties, but the systems' damping model was changed significantly. When wind power generator capacity increased in the system, doubly-fed induction generator could weaken the new local oscillation mode damping. Direct drive synchronous generator could enhance the region associated with a local oscillation damping.

Abstract:A high frequency complex Gm-C filter was proposed by using 0.18 &mu;m CMOS RF process. The filter has 20 MHz bandwidth and is centered at 46 MHz, while the pass-band flatness is less than 0.36 dB. The image band rejection is higher than 98 dB, and the out-band rejection is higher than 28 dB. The complete filter consumes less than 7.9 mA with 1.8 V supply voltage. An integrator with digital circuits based frequency tuning circuit was used to realize the automatic tuning of both center frequency and band-width. On the completion of the tuning, the circuit will automatically shut down. The 'zero power' is particularly suitable for low power applications. Simulation results show that the tuning error is less than &plusmn;1.5%.

Abstract:Soil erosion is one of the major environmental problems affecting people's survival, and the exploration of the effect of land use type on soil labile organic carbon is of significance to regional soil environment protection under the condition of soil erosion. A typical area of red soil hilly region was selected as the research site. Integrating outdoor sampling with indoor analysis, this paper studied the effect of land use type of red soil hilly region on distribution of soil labile organic carbon properties under the condition of soil erosion. The result has shown 1) land use type affects the labile organic carbon of the surface soil. There is a significant difference in the content of labile organic carbon in the 0-5 cm soil layer, but it is almost the same in the sub-layers; 2) Land use type has a great impact on the content of labile organic carbon in different poisitions of eroded land and the difference of labile organic carbon content in erosion area is higher than in deposition area; and, 3) the vertical distributions of soil labile organic carbon are basically the same among the different land use types, and the difference in surface is big, and increasingly small with the increase of soil depth.

Abstract:In order to study the active control methods to improve the crosswind stability of high-speed vehicle, we established the eight degrees of freedom nonlinear vehicle dynamic model under crosswind, and two degrees of freedom model based on piecewise linear tire features as the reference model. We designed an Active Front Steering (AFS) controller based on flexible PID control and a Direct Yaw moment Control (DYC) controller based on LQR Optimal control. Comparative analysis of the two kinds of typical operating conditions in two different active control methods for high-speed vehicle crosswind stability control was conducted. The results show that, on driving straight crosswind conditions, DYC on performances of maneuverability, stability, ability to keep track is superior to AFS, but AFS is superior to DYC in longitudinal dynamic; on crosswind front corner condition, AFS and DYC have little difference in the performance of maneuverability, stability and ability to keep track, but AFS is significantly better than DYC.

Abstract:The indices (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.51), which are related to the Chang-Zhu-Tan section of the Xiangjiang River, were selected by using the analytic hierarchy process. The weight values of these indices were given according to their importance. The water resource development potential of the Chang-Zhu-Tan section of the Xiangjiang River was calculated by establishing Gray beam function and Grey matrix. The results have shown that the water resource development potential can be evaluated with the Multi-level Grey theory. The water resource development potential in the Chang-Zhu-Tan Urban Agglomeration is 2.983, which belongs to the second-highest range [2.500, 3.250]. This indicates that the water resources of the Chang-Zhu-Tan section of the Xiangjiang River are higher within a certain time range.

Abstract:Hadfield steels were prepared by adjusting the components of the alloys by adding Cr-V-Ti-RE, Cr-V-Ti, Cr-RE , and V-Ti-Nb-RE, respectively. The investigation was carried out to study the effect of multi-elements alloying on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Hadfield steel through metallographic microscope, scanning electron microscopy, mechanical properties tests and abrasive wear tests. The results have indicated that grains are refined observably, the form and distribution of impurities are improved, and the hardness, impact toughness and wear resistance increase due to multi-elements alloying. Meanwhile, the specimen with Cr-V-Ti-RE elements has optimal comprehensive performances, its hardness and impact toughness, compared with the one without Cr-V-Ti-RE elements, increase by 12.4% and 32.5% respectively, and the wear resistance increases by 13.9%~45.4%. The wear mechanism of Hadfield steel is pit deformation and microscopic cutting under middle and low impact energy, and spalling fatigue under high impact energy.

Abstract:A 450~470 MHz monolithic LNA based on 0.5 &mu;m pHEMT was developed. The developed LNA employs resistive-shunt feedback configuration for input impedance matching, which reduces the chip size of passive elements and make it possible for on-chip fabrication. The measurement results show that the monolithic LNA has a 40 dB gain and a 0.5 dB noise figure, and the remarkable noise performance is attributed to the benefits of the absence of high-loss on-chip inductors and the low noise performance of pHEMT transistors.

Abstract:The objective of this study is to compare the casualty risk of pedestrians and bicyclists in urban traffic through an analysis of real-world accident data in China. For this purpose, 438 cases were selected as samples from the accidents collected by in-depth investigation of vehicle accidents in China. A statistic measurement of the fatality risk with respect to impact speed was carried out by logistic regression analysis. Then, 21 pedestrian and 24 bicyclist accidents were further selected for reconstruction with MADYMO program. A comparative analysis was conducted on the basisi of the results from accident analysis and computer reconstructions for the fatality risk and the head dynamic response of pedestrians and bicyclists. The results have indicated that the vehicle impact speed has a significant relationship with the fatality risk of both pedestrians and bicyclists and bicyclists suffered slightly lower fatality risk compared to pedestrians. Besides, the head impact conditions such as head impact speed and impact angle between pedestrians and bicyclists are also obviously different. These findings can contribute to the setting of a more reasonable speed limit for urban traffic in China and generate strategies for bicyclist and pedestrian head protection.

Abstract:Based on a 8-story reinforced concrete plane frame structure, The FOSM method, the tornado diagram method and the mathematical statistics method were used to discuss the sensitivity of the top displacement to uncertainties such as the seismic intensity, the site characterization, the lateral load loading mode, the structural weight, the strength and elastic modulus of concrete and the strength and elastic modulus of the rebar. The results show that the sensitivity of the top displacement to the demand curve is much stronger than the capacity curve. Accordingly, considering the uncertainty of the demand curve and ignoring the uncertainty of capacity curve when studying the pushover analysis method based on the probability theory can not only greatly simplify the analysis procedure but also ensure the accuracy of the results.

Abstract:A new, double-tensioned prestressing steel strands anchorage system (DTPSSAS), characterized by low prestress loss caused by prestressing tendon retraction, is described. When it is used for short prestressing tendons in concrete box-girder webs, this anchorage system significantly reduces prestress loss. To investigate its efficiency in reducing prestress loss, a rectangular thin plate using the DTPSSAS was devised and tested; the results demonstrated that the average rate of instantaneous prestress loss decreased from 32.35% after the first tension to 2.68% after the second tension. Further, long-term observations of prestress loss with the DTPSSAS were conducted in the laboratory and in a field test. Based on the field test of a continuous concrete box-girder bridge, the average loss rate of instantaneous prestress loss to the control tensile stress of two strands in the web is 7.61%, and the average rate of prestress loss at 150 days is 10.53%. Concurrently, the time-dependent prestress loss was calculated with Models GL2000 and CEB-FIP90 for different concrete shrinkage and creep prediction by the step-by-step calculation method. In comparison with the laboratory test results, the calculated results with the two models were greater than the test values. In addition, the effect of stress redistribution caused by the constraint of reinforcing bars to concrete shrinkage and creep was evaluated. The results revealed that the stress redistribution effect increased the vertical compressive prestress loss of concrete, indicating that the time-dependent compressive prestress loss rate of concrete was greater than the tensile prestress loss rate of prestressed tendons. In this regard, bridge engineers may need to pay attention to the stress redistribution phenomenon in vertical prestressing design. &copy; 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:Based on the pressure measurement tests of wind tunnel experiments, this paper discussed the impacts of different types of terrain and surrounding interference for peak wind pressure on the high-rise buildings. The results show that different types of terrain have a great impact on the peak pressures of high-rise buildings. When the surrounding environment of high-rise buildings remains unchanged, the peak pressure coefficients of different types of terrain are followed by B, C and D from large to small in most cases. The peak pressure impact of high-rise buildings is not only related to the relative position of the surrounding buildings, but also to the type of terrain a high-rise building at the time. For example, if the south facade is the wind surface and interfers buildings E and F located diagonally in front of the south facade, it performs a shielding effect. In this case, the vast majority of the peak pressure coefficients obtained in the terrain category of B, C and D are reduced differently in the vast majority of test points with a maximum decrease of 43%, 37% and 46% respectively.

Abstract:A simple template assisted sol-gel method was used to prepare nano-size CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> powders with high specific surface area and magnetic properties. The influences of template and heat treated temperatures on the composition, microstructure, specific area, magnetic properties as well as magnetic heating rate were studied through XRD, TEM, BET, VSM and RF heat tests. The results show that adding template helps to obtain pure spinel CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nano-magnetic particles, and with the increase of heat treated temperature, the average grain size of the as-prepared nano-particles increases, reducing its surface area. Without template, the as-prepared nano-particles exhibit serious accumulation. After adding the template, CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> particles are the approximate ellipsoid, and connected one by one, similar to a line, and its agglomeration decreases significantly. The average grain size of nano-sized particles obtained when adding template and calcined at 800&deg;C is about 70.0 nm, its specific surface area is 23.7 m<sup>2</sup>&middot;g<sup>-1</sup>, its M<inf>s</inf> equals to 79.0 emu&middot;g<sup>-1</sup>, its M<inf>r</inf> equals to 37.1 emu&middot;g<sup>-1</sup>, its coercive force equals to 856.4 G, and its magnetic heating rate is 2.95&deg;C&middot;s<sup>-1</sup>. These values are all significantly higher than that of nano-sized CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> particles obtained without template and calcined at 800&deg;C. Finally, the formation process of thread-like nano-sized CoFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> particles was discussed.

Abstract:Reduced beam section (RBS) connections are innovative connections for steel beam composite frames. The current design procedure for RBS connections is based on bare steel beams. For RBS connections with composite beams, the potential of fracture at the beam bottom flange increases because the strains at the corresponding location increase. This paper focuses on the behavior of RBS connections with composite beams. A mathematical model of the RBS connections with composite beams is derived first. Then an amplification factor is proposed for the design of the RBS connections with composite beams. Parametric analyses based on the mathematical model are conducted to examine the influence of the slab dimension, reinforcement and the beam dimension on the amplification factor. The simplified design formula is proposed for the amplification factor based on a large number of theoretical data from the parametric analysis. Finally, the mathematical models are verified by the finite element (FE) models. It is found that the proposed design formula can give satisfactory results for considering the slab effects in the design of the RBS connections with composite beams. &copy; 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:The bonding behavior of CFRP-Concrete Interface is a key performance of concrete structure strengthened with CFRP plate, and it has a critical effect on the mechanical behavior and the failure mode of the strengthened structure. This paper adopted double-shear tests on 4 concrete components strengthened with CFRP plate to investigate the mechanical behavior and the failure mode of the specimens with different bond length and to analyze the influence of different bond lengths on the ultimate capacity and the distribution of the bonding stress. According to the test results, the distribution of the CFRP strain along the bond length shows an exponential decreasing law, and the stress near the loading position is much greater than the other end. The orthotropic spring elements were adopted to simulate the adhesive layer with ANSYS software, and the finite element model of the specimen was established. The local bond slip curve obtained from the test was used as the F-d curve of spring elements. The FEA results agree with the experimental ones, confirming the correctness of the FEM. Based on the bond slip curves obtained from the test, some bond-slip constitutive relationships were fitted according to several classic bond-slip constitutive relations. The test and FEA results show that the CFRP plate has begun peeling from the concrete surface when the tensile stress applied to CFRP reaches 24% of the tensile strength of the material. To ensure the full utilization of CFRP strength, the anchorage for CFRP plate should be adopted.

Abstract:In collapse-resistant design of structures, understanding primary structural failure-mechanisms and alternative load paths under accidental extreme loads is important. A quasi-static experimental method is used to simulate the sudden loss of a column in a single story concrete flat slab-column structure. In a series of experiments on two identical large-scale models, an interior, exterior, and corner column of the structure were replaced by mechanical jacks during the fabrication of the structure. After application of uniform loads of increasing intensity, the jack representing the lost column was unloaded. In the first model test wherein an interior column was removed, a downward concentrated load was also applied on the upper end of the interior column until the structure collapsed. Elastic behavior, yield-line mechanisms, and compressive and tensile membrane actions in the flat slab-column structure were observed during the collapse tests. The results provide valuable information on the load transfer mechanisms in a flat slab-column structure when critical columns are removed. &copy; 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:This paper took the actual 110 kV high-voltage coaxial GIS as the research object. Its mathematical model and 3D magnetic-thermal coupled finite element model were both established, and then, the electromagnetic field and eddy current field were analyzed. In order to analyze the influence of the shell eddy current loss on GIS thermal distribution, the thermal distributions under the two conditions of taking and not taking the shell eddy current loss were calculated by combining the classical heat transfer theory. The simulation results indicate that the thermal distribution is not uniform because of air convention, and the thermal distribution has the characteristics of bilateral symmetry and from top to below. The highest local temperature rise point is at the top of the GIS busbar. The shell eddy current loss has some effect on the thermal distribution, but the temperature rise difference is in 0.5. Therefore, the research work can provide important reference for the design and check of high-voltage GIS.

Abstract:The transmission characteristics of the structure of defective rectangular ring resonator based on metal-insulator-metal waveguide were investigated in the finite difference time domain method. This structure consists of a waveguide channel and a defective rectangular ring resonator, which is parallel to the waveguide. Compared with the perfect rectangular ring resonator, the structure with defect destroys the symmetry of the resonant modes in the resonator, which results in a novel filter function of the complex resonator. The effective length of the structure depends on the size of the defect, so filtering wavelength can be tuned by adjusting the dimension of the defect. The numerical simulation results are essentially in agreement with the transmission line theory calculation results. In addition, the coupling strength between the waveguide channel and defective rectangular ring resonator is dependent on the defect location, which is useful in the control of the transmittance at filtering wavelength. Compared with the other filtering structures, our structure can realize more broadband segment filtering, effectively adjust the filtering wavelength and control the transmittance without changing the overall size. When the size of detect is chosen on a certain value, a new double degenerated mode appears, which improves the filtering properties of the structure. It has potential application in integrated optics due to its miniaturization and simple fabrication process.

Abstract:To extract the damage sensitive features directly from the vibration response, a damage identification method based on the wavelet packet decomposition-local mean decomposition and the permutation entropy was proposed, without requiring the exciting force. The wavelet packet decomposition was applied to decompose the original vibration signal into a set of narrow band signals, and then, the local mean decomposition method was used to decompose the narrow band signal, which can extract the low energy components effectively. After that, the permutation entropy was obtained to detect the structural damage. The relative permutation entropy between the test data and the sample data was obtained to identify the damage pattern. The experiment results show that the proposed method can be used to identify the structural damage effectively.

Abstract:This paper presented an approach which combines space division and rules compression in an effort to allow the real-time updates and TCAM chips storage happening at the same time. In the approach, the TCAM chip was divided into two partitions, a real-time update area and a compression storage area. The former was assigned in the front of the chip for storing real-time updating rules sent by the controller, and the latter had the function of compressing and storing rules generated by the server within certain time period. We made a comprehensive analysis of the space division ratio and conducted simulation experiments on the rules generated by the ClassBench tool. The experiment results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach.

Abstract:Variable predictive model-based class discriminate (VPMCD) classification method was built on homoscedastic regression model. When the regression model is heteroscedastic, it will lower the prediction accuracy. So a WLS -variable predictive mode-based class discriminate (WVPMCD) pattern recognition method was presented. Its parameter estimation approach uses the weighted least square method to replace ordinary least square method to eliminate homoscedasticity, thus raising the accuracy of pattern recognition. In this paper, LCD (Local characteristic-scale decomposition) approach was adopted to decompose the roller bearing vibration signal. Then, the singular values are abstracted from the component matrix and formed into fault feature vector which will act as the input in WVPMCD. The analysis results from the roller bearing vibration signals of normal, roller fault, inner race fault and outer race fault demonstrate that WVPMCD has a higher recognition rate when the regression model is heteroscedastic.

Vibration analysis results have shown that the first order natural frequency of torsional vibration of the yaw system is 17.6947 Hz, the second order natural frequency is 55.8166 Hz, the third order natural frequency is 85.1412 Hz, and the fourth order natural frequency is 170.1823 Hz. Dynamic analysis results have shown that the nacelle has to bear severe oscillation at the end of the yaw, the amplitude is as high as 0.15 rad, and it will last 20 s. The vibration of the yaw system can be reduced by adding a feedback control to the frame of the megawatt-class wind turbine.

Abstract:The composite insulator surface hydrophobicity detection is one of the primary means to determine its anti flashover performance. This paper introduces the sparse representation classification algorithm to classify composite insulator's hydrophobic image. It uses the smallest normal method to calculate the coefficient of sparse representation and searches the training sample image that best matches the test image by calculating the minimum residual image, therefore the test image's hydrophobic HC level is accurately identified. The algorithm has successfully avoided complicated feature extraction in general pattern recognition algorithms, thus providing a new way for composite insulator's hydrophobic image recognition and detection. The experimental results show that the method can be effectively applied in the composite insulator's hydrophobic image classification.

Abstract:The laser welding test was carried out on the 5083 aluminum alloy with thickness 1. 0 mm and the 6016 aluminum alloy with thickness 1. 2 mm. The relationship between plasma MgI spectrum signal and the process parameters as well as welding quality were studied by testing the MgI singal of laser welded dissimilar alloy and by analyzing fracture morphology, microhardness and mechanical properties in the joint by using spectroscopic measurement system, scanning electron microscope, vickers microhardness machine, and computer control electronic universal testing machine. The results show that, with the speed increasing, MgI spectrum signal strength is reduced; the focus obviously affects MgI signal while the laser power changs the whole MgI signal amplitude slightly. When MgI relative strength appears smaller or larger, the specimens have lack or over welding; MgI plasma with strong fluctuations leads to defects such as porosity and low mechanical performance while smooth MgI signal has less defect and good mechanical performance. The real-time control welding process X-R<inf>s</inf> is established based on MgI spectral signal corresponding to the quality of weldment and Hugh hart SPC control theory.

Abstract:Five precast concrete specimens with steel cable connections were tested statically. These specimens include three wall-wall specimens and two floor-floor specimens. Then the existing methods were used to calculate the shearing resistance of the connections. The results show that the shear capacity of the seam is mainly composed of shear friction of the steel cable in tension and the dowel action of the steel cable. The specimens exhibit excellent ductility. Based on the test results, in-depth analyses were conducted to study the behavior and the failure mechanism of the connection with steel cable. Using rational assumptions, we proposed a trilinear model to predict the shear behavior of the steel cable connection. The results of the trilinear model are in good agreement with those obtained in the test, which provide useful reference to the design and construction of total precast concrete structures with steel cable connections.

Abstract:The effect of biosurfactantrhamnolipid alone and its combination with cation chemical surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) on sludge dewaterability was investigated by determining the water content of dewatered cakes and capillary suction time (CST). When the rhamnolipid dose was 0.01 g&middot;g<sup>-1</sup> , the water content of sludge after centrifugation was lower by about 2.4% compared with raw sludge, while the water content of filtered sludge cake was lower by about 10.8%; but the value of CST increased from 27.3 s to 48.8 s. The results showed that the addition of the biosurfactantrhamnolipid could significantly promote the dewatering of sludge, but would slow down the dewatering rate of activated sludge. Compared with rhamnolipid or CTAB alone, the combination of rhamnolipid and CTAB (the combination proportion was 1:1, 1:2 or 1:3) could not only decrease the water content of dewatered sludge cakes, but also improve the dewatering rate of activated sludge.

Abstract:By using industrial pseudo-boehmite prepared spherical alumina powder with sol - gel and spray granulation technology, the powder was calcined at different temperatures in the muffle furnace. SEM was used to observe the microstructure of the powder obtained. The phase composition of the powder calcined at different temperatures was probed with XRD. The size distribution of powder was tested by using mastersize. And integrated surface roughness tester was used to test the surface roughness of the workpiece. The results show that the shape of the powder prepared through spray granulation and calcination is spherical. In addition, as the temperature increases gradually, the phase changes from &gamma;-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> into &theta;-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, and then into &alpha;-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>. When the calcination temperature is too high, the power will bond with each other. If the time of heat preservation is prolonged, the powder will grow along the dense area. And when the powder has good crystallinity and more uniform size, its polishing performance is much better.

Abstract:The manufacturing stage, transport stage and on-site construction stage of building materials consume large amount of energy. Based on the three stages, the calculation method for energy and exergy consumption was presented, and the concept of exergy-energy ratio was proposed to evaluate the sustainability of building energy use. A case of a research and development center located in Hunan was analyzed. The results have shown that the energy consumption of building envelope construction mainly comes from the manufacturing stage of building materials. Unit building area energy consumed by concrete and steel accounted respectively for about 44% and 41% of the total energy consumption of building materials production. Unit building area exergy consumed by concrete and steel accounted respectively for about 38% and 48% of the total exergy consumption of building materials production. From the perspective of exergy-energy ratio, the maximum value is steel, 0.92; and the minimum is cement, 0.59. The exergy-energy ratio of building envelope construction is 0.79. The results can provide reference for the research of energy consumption resulting from "uncompleted building". The exergy assessment method presented can be applied to other similar buildings, and can provide reference for sustainable building construction.

Abstract:In the presence of cesium hydroxide, the reaction of O, O-diethylphosphonate with alkynylselenides at room temperature does not provide the expected additional product by using dimethyl formamide (DMF) as the solvent, but rather causes the cleavage of Se-Csp bond and gives the corresponding terminal alkynes and Se-aryl phosphoroselenoates in 89~95% yields. The influence of substituent at the alkynes and selenium atom on the reaction was investigated, and the results showed that the reaction was not sensitive to the electronic nature. The reaction mechanism was that O, O-diethylphosphonate reacted with cesium hydroxide to produce (EtO)<inf>2</inf>P<sup>-</sup>(O)Cs<sup>+</sup>, which underwent nucleophilic attacks on alkynylselenides to produce Se-aryl phosphoroselenoates and RC&equiv;C<sup>-</sup>Cs<sup>+</sup>. The latter was hydrolyzed in the presence of water to form terminal alkynes and catalyst cesium hydroxide. The method could provide a new and simple path for the cleavage of Se-CsP.

Abstract:Based on the classified site criterion in current seismic design code of building (GB 50011-2010) and quantitative classification scheme of near-fault ground motions proposed by Baker, the sites of 746 accelerograms from the strong-motion databank of some countries were classified as four site classes, and the 746 accelerograms were classified as far-field, near-fault and near-fault pulse-type ground motion accelerograms. Using the selected accelerograms, the empirical equations of near-fault pulse-type ground motion corresponding to four kinds of sites were presented for the inelastic displacement ratio spectra of constant ductility and constant yielding strength. The effects of site condition and different ground motion parameters on inelastic displacement ratio spectra were also evaluated. It is concluded that the influences of near-fault pulse-type ground motion on displacement ratio spectra of constant ductility and constant yielding strength are significant at periods [0.3 s, 5 s] and periods [0.5 s, 3 s] respectively, and site condition can control the period ranges of the above significant effect. PGV/PGA can provide the largest influence on displacement ratio spectra for near-field ground motions.

Abstract:We presented a skeleton-driven model deformation method for the effective reuse of finite element (FE) models in auto-body structural analysis. Skeletons were defined to describe the body structure and control blocks embedding the body structure based on the geometry of the given FE model. Then, the constraint between the skeleton curve set and control blocks of the given model were established so that the user can derive the desired shape of control blocks by editing the skeleton curves. Finally, the deformed FE model was reconstructed by using the spatial deformation method. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method can obtain physically plausible deformed results and achieve the effective reuse of the given FE models. In addition, using skeleton curves as the handles can provide users with an intuitive way to manipulate FE models.

Abstract:A new special machine tool for the precision riveting and assembly of the automotive hub bearing unit was proposed, which could adjust the inclination angle of the rivet tail, real-time measurement of the riveting and assembly force and displacement of the stage, and automatic precision adjustment of stop position of the riveting and assembly. Its parameters, such as the inclination angle of the rivet tail, feed, riveting and assembly force, were theoretically analyzed and the prototype was manufactured. Experiment results show that it has a maximum axial riveting and assembly force of 30 T. The positioning precision of the stage is less than 2 &mu;m and the production efficiency is up to 3 000 pieces per shift. The theoretical reliability of the hub bearing unit produced by the special machine tool is above 300 000 km. It satisfies the assembly requirement of the automotive hub bearing unit.

Abstract:Based on the compressed sensing theory, the MP (Matching Pursuit, MP) algorithm was applied to image compression coding. This paper presented the reconstructed method of the atomic library and reduced the computational complexity of the traditional MP decomposition by using the decomposition method of the block compressed sensing image. Aiming at the low coding rate problem of the traditional MP algorithm, a coding method of MP atoms was proposed, and the coefficient of the atomic and positional parameters was encoded by using MP atomic energy and position distribution characteristics. The experiment results have shown that: 1)the decomposition method of the block compressed sensing image can effectively reduce the computational complexity of sparse decomposition; 2)that the compression coding method, besides maintaining the strengths of the traditional MP image coding, can effectively improve the coding performance and the encoding rate, and reflect the advantage of the sparse decomposition over the traditional decomposition methods.

Abstract:The purpose of this paper was to study the vegetation cover and water level change functions of East Dongting Lake wetland. The vegetation cover corresponding to water level change was also investigated. After the preliminary treatment of TIMESAT, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series was adopted to analyze the relationship between vegetation cover and water-level in the divided zones (A, B, and C). Then, NDVI sample autocorrelation curve was used to show the differences of the three areas under study. Lastly, the spearman correlation coefficient (&rho;<inf>s</inf>) of NDVI time-series corresponding to water-level was used to discuss the effects of the Three Gorges Dam. The results indicated that, (1) all the NDVI time-series under the impacts of water level formed an annual cyclical change style. Every cycle had two crests, one in April and the other in October. In the flood period, the curve formed a trough in July. Quadratic polynomial fitting showed that the critical water level of maximum vegetation cover was about 24-25 m. (2) The degree of the effects of water level on vegetation cover was Zone A&lt;Zone B&lt;Zone C. This phenomenon was mainly caused by the differences of elevation and vegetation types. (3) After the analysis of the Spearman rank correlation of 2003, 2006 and 2009, big changes took place in aquatic-terrestrial zone. In these three years, the storage water level of the Three Gorges went up from 135m to 175 m, and the &rho;<inf>s</inf> of the areas studied increased to 0.641, 0.687 and 0.518, respectively. The water storage of the Three Gorges Dam affected the relationship between the vegetation cover and the water level in East Dongting Lake.

Abstract:By analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used calculation methods and introducing a nonlinear pile-soil interaction model, a method for calculating the internal forces of cantilever piles was proposed, which can consider the pile-soil interaction. Firstly, finite bar elements were used to discretize the pile structures, and then, elemental stiffness matrixes were calculated and incorporated into global stiffness matrix. Secondly, the nonlinear function relationship between earth pressure and pile displacement in or out of the foundation pit was assumed, and then the nonlinear function array of joint loads was established. Thirdly, the overall stiffness equation was formed according to the global stiffness matrix and nodal load function array, and was solved to obtain the nodal displacement array by using the Newton-Raphson method. Finally, the internal forces of pile and lateral earth pressure were calculated with the elemental stiffness equations and nodal displacement array. The example analysis shows that the proposed method is simple and convenient, fully reflecting the characteristics of nonlinear variation of earth pressure acting on piles, and revealing the mechanism of pile-soil interaction well. Therefore, it is suitable for the internal force calculation of cantilever piles.

Abstract:An improved operating strategy of genetic operator sorting genetic algorithm (GA) was used for the multi-objective optimization of crane's lifting path planning in three-dimensional space. First, space path planning of multiple degrees of freedom was transformed into that of planar path points planning by constructing mathematical models of crane's lifting scene and pose space. Second, the optimization targets, including the shortest lifting path, best security, minimum of movement changes, were determined. Then, suitable direction and step size of the insert operator and mutation operator were selected with the addition of a memory operator for multi-objective optimization. Experiments have demonstrated that this algorithm can take several factors into account and generate multiple paths to select at one time.

Abstract:The coil copper resistance of the large-power rectifier transformer used in the metal smelting, chemical and electrolytic industries increases as the temperature increases, and so does the corresponding basic copper loss. The cooling system of the transformer ensures that the rectifier transformer runs under specified operation conditions of temperature rise. In addition, it reduces the windings' consumption by lowering the temperature. However, the application of cooling system will consume a sum of energy as well. It depends on whether the whole system reaches energetic minimum. This paper made a careful study on the relationship between the power dissipation of the rectifier transformer, the power consumption of the cooling system and temperature according to the operating data of an aluminum company. The research reveals the optimal temperature rise and cooling power for the minimum energy loss of the rectifier transformer, which paves a way for realizing the rectifier transformer's comprehensive energy saving.

Abstract:A 9.4-m-long, full-scale glued laminated bamboo (glubam) bridge model was constructed to duplicate a prototype truckload bridge. The soffit of the 600-mm-deep and 120-mm-wide glubam girders was further enhanced with carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets. The midspan deflections of the bamboo girders were obtained over the course of 3.7 years from creep tests under the gravity load of the bridge. The results indicate that the average creep deflection of the girders after 3.7 years was within the acceptable range. It was found that the creep deflection was affected by seasonal humidity and temperature. After 3.7 years of creep loading, the bridge model was loaded with sandbags and cast iron weight blocks until failure. The final failure mode was identified as the flexural failure of a section where a finger joint of one layer of the glubam girder was located. &copy; 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:The influences of Cu and Ce on the microstructures and mechanical properties of Al-7Si-0.35Mg alloys were investigated by using the control variables. The alloys underwent the same heat treatment: solution at 505&deg;C for ten hours. Then, the specimens were immediately cooled by water quenching. Finally, the samples were aged at 160&deg;C for 6 hours. The results have shown that Cu and Ce have a significant influence on the improvement of the tensile strength and elongation of the heat treated alloys. After heat treatment, the tensile strength of Al-7Si-0.35Mg alloy can be increased by more than 50% with 3.4%~4.0% Cu, when the Ce content is certain. The tensile strengths of Al-7Si-0. 35Mg alloys with 3.6%~3.8% Cu increase above 390 MPa. Ce has an effective modification on the morphology of eutectic silicon. When the Cu content is certain, the elongations of alloys can be improved from 4.2% to 7.4% with 0.15% Ce. Adding excess Cu and Ce to Al-7Si-0.35Mg alloys, Al<inf>9</inf>Ce<inf>2</inf>Cu<inf>5</inf>Si<inf>3</inf> phases emerge. The results have illustrated that Al-7Si-0.35Mg alloys with 3.6% Cu and 0.15% Ce can attain good comprehensive tensile properties.

Abstract:To address the problems in the evaluation of science and technology awards, this paper proposed an improved CRITIC method, which was modified by coefficient of standard deviation to carry on the dynamic empowerment. And combined with cloud model, the method used reverse cloud generator to construct a fuzzy evaluation matrix and used the virtual cloud to calculate the expectation entropy and hyper entropy of evaluated project to get and sort the evaluation results. This method can consider the fuzziness and the randomness of expert score in the evaluation of science and technology awards, and realize the conversion between the qualitative linguistic and the quantitative numerical value, thus reducing the interference of expert subjective factors and making the results more accurate and objective.

Abstract:A new method for the use of methanol in IC engine was proposed. Methanol was evaporated into vapor by IC engine exhaust heat and used as gas fuel. This concept was applied to both naturally aspirated engine and turbocharged engine. By comparing the two schemes with the original gasoline engine, the improvement potentials of power performances and fuel economy of new concepts can be predicted. The results have shown that, when naturally aspirated engine is fueled with methanol vapor, power has a slight decline with the maximum of 7.1%, and thermal efficiency has a slight increase with the maximum of 3.0 percentage points; when turbocharged engine is fueled with methanol vapor, the power performance and fuel economy have a great improvement over both the original gasoline engine and methanol vapor engine. At the boost pressure of 1.5 bar, the maximum improvement of thermal efficiency comes up to 4.0 percentage points. All these can prove that it is a useful concept for IC engine energy conservation.

Abstract:An evaluation procedure was proposed for buildings adjacent to excavation by taking the settlements, inclinations and damage coefficients of buildings as typical indexes. Interval theory was used to describe the randomness of these above indexes. For the representativeness of these indexes, the settlements and inclinations of buildings were calculated by finite element simulation, and the damage coefficients were introduced to reflect the damage states of buildings. Four membership functions of S-type were proposed for the fuzziness of evaluation standards. Super weight method of real numbers was introduced and improved to interval numbers for the characteristics of building risks. Application results have shown that there are deviations among the risk grades judged respectively by these three indexes, but the risk grades synthetically judged correspond with the measured results approximately.

Abstract:To overcome the drawbacks in the traditional interval perturbation method due to the unpredictable effect of neglecting the higher-order terms of Neumann series, a modified interval perturbation method is presented and used to determine the static response interval of the structure with interval parameters. In the proposed method, the inverse of the interval structural stiffness matrix is approximated by a modified Neumann expansion in which the higher-order terms of Neumann series are considered. For the uncertain structure with large uncertainty levels, the subinterval analysis technique is introduced into the proposed method and the approach to determine the number of subintervals is proposed. The modified interval and subinterval perturbation methods are implemented in the finite-element framework. Numerical results on a six-bar space truss structure and a shell structure with interval parameters verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. Hence, the modified interval and subinterval perturbation methods can be successfully applied to the nonprobabilistic structural model, and in the future have wide application prospects. &copy; 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:A silane coupling agent (named KH-550) was used to modify composite intumescent flame retardant containing tea saponin (CTS-IFR), which was applied in flame retardant coatings. The preparation conditions of the silane coupling agent modified tea saponin flame retardant(SMTS-IFR)were investigated. The structure of SMTS-IFR was characterized by FT-IR and SEM, the thermal decomposition properties were performed by simultaneous thermal analyzer, and the flame retardant and combustion performance of coatings containing SMTS-IFR(SMTS-IPRC) were also measured by Cone calorimeter. The results showed that the suitable modification reaction conditions were at the temperature of 80&deg;C, the reaction time of 4 h, and the addition of 2.5% silane coupling agent in tea saponin intumescent flame retardant. It showed that the reaction between silane coupling agent and flame retardant system occured, and the flame retardant was cladded and dispersed uniformly. SMTS-IFR had good thermal stability and higher carbon residue at high temperature compared with that of CTS-IFR. Cone calorimeter test showed that coating sample containing SMTS-IFR had a good flame retardant with a heat release rate for an average of 62.29 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, a total heat release of 52.66 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>, a mean effective heat of combustion of 11.31 kJ/kg, and an average mass loss rate of 0.04691 g/s in the combustion process, which was significantly improved compared with the coating containing unmodified flame retardant.

Abstract:Some windows with low peak side lobe level and quick decay rate were used to eliminate the errors of dielectric loss factor tan&delta; measurement caused by non-synchronized sampling and non-integral period truncation. In this paper, the side lobe characteristic of Rife-Vincent window was discussed, and an approach for tan&delta; measurement based on Rife-Vincent window double spectrum line interpolation FFT was proposed. Then, the applicable rectification formulas of the interpolation were obtained by using polynomial curve fit functions. The arithmetic expression of fundamental initial phase and tan&delta; was deduced. The measurement system for this approach is composed of AD73360L+ ADSP-BF531+ PIC32MX460F512L. The simulation and test results show that Rife-Vincent window function can restrain spectral leakage well, and the influences on tan&delta; measurement, which are caused by harmonic, fundamental frequency fluctuation, sampling time length in change and white noise, are all overcome by using this approach. It can be utilized flexibly to obtain precise and steady results.

Abstract:The extension &amp; compaction scanning algorithm based on LTI (Linear Travel-time Interpolation) ray tracing algorithm can properly trace the ray path of the direct wave, diffraction wave and echo's, but it has the following problems: low computational efficiency and slow convergence speed. Aiming at these problems and using the cross-scan mode to improve the algorithm, an improved extension &amp; compaction scanning algorithm based on the cross-scan mode was presented. Theoretical analysis and the results of numerical calculation show that the improved algorithm not only maintains all the advantages of the extension &amp; compaction scanning algorithm, but also has a higher computational efficiency. When the model is mesh more refined, the advantage of the improved algorithm is more significant in computational efficiency.
